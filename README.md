Minewarp is a simple plugin to let Minecraft players set and use warp 
points, using `/warp` and `/home`. It currently does not have permissions
built-in, so only use this on a server with trusted players (unless, of course,
you want everyone to be able to set and use warp points!)

## Building

To build Minewarp, you'll need a Java compiler and Maven 2.2 or later. Perform
the following:

1. Clone the Minewarp Git repository:
   `git clone git://github.com/SiebeTolsma/Minewarp.git`
2. Run Maven to build:
   `mvn clean package`
3. (Optional) Run convert.bat for Visual J# support:
   `cd ikvm; convert.bat`

Note that if you are using Visual J#, you will likely only want to `clean` once.
After that, simply run `mvn package` to build instead.

## Developing

Minewarp welcomes contributions in the form of pull requests and issue reports. 
If you feel like working on Minewarp, just fork the repository and start working. 
Once you're done submit a pull request.

Note that only pulls that adhere to the current coding styles are accepted. In 
short, put braces on a new line, use four spaces for indent, and at a minimum 
put a short Javadoc comment on each method.
